Js is a subset of typescript
All js is ts but not all ts is js
Benefits:
 - Static typing
 - Code completion
 - Refactoring
 - Shorthand notations

Type of languages:
 - statically-typed(c++, c#, java): does not have to compile to error and must declare a variable and what type of data goes into it
 - dynamically typed(js, python, ruby): has to compile before erroring

What is typescript:
- just javascript with type casting aka oop principles + a lot more

Pros:
- insane scalability
- ability to use features js cant in js applications
- allows for better maitenance/changes for the lifetime of the applications

Cons:
- always have to compile(transpilation)
- stricter coding style
- technically more typing

Why you should use typescript:
- research has shwon that ts can spot 15% of common bugs
- readability - it is easier to see what the code is supposed to do and when working in a team, it is easier to see what the other developers intended to
- it is popular - knowing typescript will enable you to apply to more good jobs
- learning typescript will give you a better understanding and anew perspective on javascript
- addresses the shortcomings of js

Why you shouldnt use typescript:
 - typescripte takes longer to write than js as you have to specify types so for smaller solo projects it might not be worth understanding
 - typescript has to be compiled - which can take time, especially in larger projects
 BUTTTT.....
  - but the extra time that you have to spend writing more precise code and compiling will be more than saved by how many fewer bugs you will have in your code
  - for many projects - especially medium to large projects - typescript will save you lots of time and headaches
  - and if you already know js, typescript wont be hard to learning

How to get started:
 - open vscode
 - cd../ to github
 - npm install typescript --save-dev 
 - npx tsc -v [for getting the version]
 - cd into the project
 - npm init -y

How to compile:
 - for specific file - npx tsc [name of file]
 - for all files in the terminal folder - npx tsc
 - if you want a specific name - npx tsc index.ts --outfile file-name.js
 - have the file watch sass - npx tsc index.ts -w

Watch Mode
 - there is a built in watch mode, similar to nodemon that will compile every time a change is made and saved
 - npx tsc app.ts -w //watches app.ts
 - npx tsc -w //watches files in dir
Initialize to TS
 - watch mode does not work without a config file
 - to configure your ts compiler then you need to create the config file using:
 - npx tsc -init
Config Options
 - there are many options, the few that we will cover are the ones that I think you have the most chance of actually using in the future
 - "target":"ES2016" states the target level of JS that you want to use the ts to compile down to. "ES6" is what you likely want to be using but if you want to be sure then you can use ES5
 - the lib option has a bunch of different libraries pre-installed that you can add but there is no reason for us to mess with this option right now. In the future you will likely be adding new libaries to these options
 - source map creates a file that allows you to dewbug your TS file using the JS file. It creates a map while compiling that tells the run time where the js lines are created from when using the ts files
 - "outDir": "./" defines where the js files should be placed when they are done being compiled. By default they are in the same directory as the ts file but you are able to place them in a different directory
 - "rootDir": "./" tells the compiler where to look when finding files to compile. By default it is in the root directory where you are running the init/watch command
 - "noEmitOnError": true   Typically when there is a type error the terminal will let you know but the file will still compile. If you enable this setting then the JS will not be created if there are any errors in the code
 - "strict": true   This makes sure you are typing clear and concise code and shows errors if you don't. When strict is true, it activates every option below it, you are able to set this false if you want to customize the strict options yourself
Overview
 - when creating a progrma using TS you do not want to push the TS files and the js files since they are essentially the same thing. You should always have *.js in your gitignore from now on

ES6 FEATURES

ES6
 - uses let and const to define variables in different ways
 - Default Function Params: you are able to define a default value for function parameters, if the value is not defined it will automatically fill in a value
 - Spead Operator: Adding ... before an iterable object will add each item from that object inidividually
 - Rest Parameters: Allows the use of ... in the parameters to create an array from all the items in the parameters
 - Destructuring: Multiple variables can be defined at once using destructuring for arrays or objects
ES5
 - only uses var to define variables
 - Default Function Params: you define the value in the function if the value was not defined
 - Spread Operator: The items are added to a temporary variables one at a time using a for loop
 - Rest Parameters: Functions are created with an 'arguments' value that you can loop through with a for loop
 - Destructuring: Each needs to be defined by hand
One Last Thing:
 - Sometimes there will be erros when importing libs or using the DOM
 - You can ignore erros like this by using the !
 - This should only be used when you know that the error is covered and proper

TYPE SCRIPT BASICS:
 - ts is microsoft's attempt to push js in a more object oriented direction
 - one big step to doing that is adding types to the variables and objects
 - you can add a type to any variable by placing colons, :, after it

Basic Types
 - number
 - string
 - boolean
 - {}=object
 - []=array
 - {'str1','str2',...}=enum     defines allowed values in a variable
 - [string,number]=tuple    defines allowed types in order in an array

When to use typecasting
 - ALWAYS when defining variables, parameters, or functions

Types - variables
 - adding types to variables is very easy, everytime you create one just add a colons
 - let name: string = 'Jimmy';
 - let appId: number = 12873;
 - because of our settings they will not allow implicit 'any' types, which will help you know when to do it while starting outDir

Types - functions
 - the parameters in a function should be given types to avoid errors while developing
 - function add(n1: number, n2: number) => return n1 + n2;
 - it is also good idea to add a type for the output of a function
 -function printResult(num: number) : number {
    console.log("Result: " + num)
    return num
  }
 - the second you add a type for the output of a function you need a return statement or it will error
Arrow Function
 - const addArrow = (n1:number, n2:number): number => n1 + n2
 -const printResult = (num: number): void => {
    console.log('result: ' + num);
 }
 - void is a common phrase meaning nothing is being returned

Types - objects and arrays
 - just like modeling with mongoose, we are able to model objects using type casting
 -const person: {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    hobbies: string[];
    role: [number, string];
 }
 - objects can be typecast inside of another type casted object
 -const product: {
    id: string;
    price: number;
    tags: string[];
    details: {
      title: string;
      description: string;
    }
 }

Types - enum
 - to create an enumertated list(enum) use the keyword enum followed by an object of human readable values and the behind the scenes values they represent
 -enum Role {
    ADMIN = 'ADMIN',
    READ_ONLY = 0,
    AUTHOR = 100,
 }
 - largest advantage for enum is consistency
 - if we create a role enum, then everywhere we use that role in the future is guaranteed to have the same value, 0 or "admin"
 - the other advantage is storage size
 - we are able to give roles using numbers to save space, while using enums to create human readable Code
Types - any
 - there is a unique type that we talked have talked about before called any
 - just like it sounds, any can be any data type
Types - unions
 - variables can accept more than one type for instance a function may take a number or a string
 - that can be defined with a vertical lines
 - let result : string | number;
Types - aliases
 - if a union type is going to be used often then it is more useful to create a custom type called an alias by using the 'type' keyword
 - type Combinable = number | string;
 - remember: customer classes are capital
 - an object alias can also be created so that several functions can all use the same type, creating consistency in your code
 -type User = {name: string; age: number};
  
  function greet(user: User) {
    console.log('hi, i am ' + user.name);
  }

  function is Older(user: User, checkAge: number) {
    return checkAge > user.age;
  }

Types - function types
 - ts is also able to store entire functions as aliases
 - let add: (a: number, b: number) => number;
 - the arrow is used to define the type of the returned value

OOP - classes and interfaces

Keywords

Pulic
 - the public keyword allows variables to be used inside of several classes and files without an issue in ts
 - this is important because of modules since they run when the file is 'required'
 - this is the default value of a variable

Private
 - private makes the variable unchangeable outside of a class
 - most of the time this is used to protect important information that you don't want to be overwritten
 - use getters and setters to access variables

Protected
 - private values are not available to classes that extend the original class
 - protected values are available to extended classes, everything else is the same as private
 -class Employee {
  public empName: string = 'dan';
  protected empCode : number = 0;
 }

 class SalesEmployee extends Employee {
  private department: string = 'health';
  public checkCode = () => console.log(this.empCode);
 }

 let empObj = SalesEmployee('John Smith', 123, 'Sales');
 empObj.empCode; //compiler error

Readonly
 - as the name implies this throws an error if you try to change the value of a variable
 - you use this in calsses since you can't use const

These notes sucked!!
GO LOOK AT PERSON_EXAMPLE.TS INSTEAD
Copy and pasted person_example.ts
class Person {
    constructor(id:number, name: string, ssn:string, email:string){
        this.id = id;
        this._ssn = ssn;
        this.email = email;
    }
    //readonly property can be accessed but not modified
    public readonly id:number;

    //private property can only be accessed inside this class
    private _ssn:string;

    //protected property can be accessed in this class and subclasses
    protected email: string;
}

let alan = new Person(1, "Alan Sanchez", "832-19-8898", "daddysfootsoldier@gmail.com");
console.log(alan);

Static
 - static makes values and methods available without needing to Initialize the class first
 - we have already been using this, a good example is Math.PI or Math.min(), we don't need to make let math = new Math()
 
 class Circle {
    static pi: number = 3.14;
    static findArea = (rad: number) => Circle.pi * rad ** 2
}

console.log(Circle.pi) //3.14
console.log(Circle.findArea(10)) //314

Abstract
 - abstract makes classes, methods, or variables only accessible to extended classes
